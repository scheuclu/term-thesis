The LaTeX package "struktex.dtx" contains some macros which
generate Nassi Shneidermann structure charts

It consists of six files:
    LIESMICH          - this file in a german version
    README            - this file
    struktex.dtx      - the actual package with integrated bi-lingual
                        documentation
    struktex.ins      - the installation script
    struktex.de.pdf   - the documentation in german language
    struktex.en.pdf   - the documentation in english language

For further information see the documentation.

At this moment the english documentation is very erroneous, I'm not an english 
native speaker and some times I've missed updating the translation (the 
package first was intended for internal use only). But I think the examples are 
very helpful and speaking for themselves.

Any hint as well as any proposal for further development are welcome at my
email-address j.hoffmann@fh-aachen.de.
