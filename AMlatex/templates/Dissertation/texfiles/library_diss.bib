	abstract = {Over the last two decades, significant research effort has been directed towards developing vehicle transmissions that reduce the energy consumption of an automobile. This effort has been a direct consequence of the growing environmental concern imposing the directives of reduced exhaust emissions and increased vehicle efficiency on current vehicle manufacturers and users. A continuously variable transmission ({CVT}) offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits, which consequently enhances the fuel economy and dynamic performance of a vehicle by better matching the engine operating conditions to the variable driving scenarios. Although a {CVT} plays a crucial role in the plan to improve vehicle fuel economy, its complete potential has not been realized in a mass-production vehicle. The current paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on dynamic modeling and control of friction-limited continuously variable transmissions. The basic concepts, mathematical models, and computational schemes are extensively discussed. Challenges and critical issues for future research on modeling and control of such {CVTs} are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This book presents the fundamentals of sparse matrix algorithms, from theory to algorithms and data structures to working code. The focus is on direct methods for solving systems of linear equations; iterative methods and solvers for eigenvalue problems are beyond the scope of this book. The goal is to impart a working knowledge of the underlying theory and practice of sparse matrix algorithms, so that you will have the foundation to understand more complex (but faster) algorithms. Methods that operate on dense submatrices of a larger sparse matrix (multifrontal and supernodal methods) are much faster, but a complete sparse matrix package based on these methods can be tens of thousands of lines long. The sparse {LU}, Cholesky, and {QR} factorization codes in {MATLAB}®, for example, total about 100,000 lines of code. Trying to understand the sparse matrix technique by starting with such huge codes is a daunting task. To overcome this obstacle, a sparse matrix package, {CSparse}, has been written specifically for this book. It can solve Ax = b when A is unsymmetric, symmetric positive definite, or rectangular, using about 2,200 lines of code. Although simple and concise, it is based on recently developed methods and theory. All of {CSparse} is printed in this book. Take your time to read and understand these codes; do not gloss over them. You will find them much easier to comprehend and learn from than their larger (yet faster) cousins. The larger packages you may use in practice are based on much of the theory and some of the algorithms presented more concisely and simply in {CSparse}. For example, the {MATLAB} statement x=A{\textbackslash}b relies on the theory and algorithms from almost every section of this book. Parallel sparse matrix algorithms are excluded, yet they too rely on the theory discussed here.},

	shorttitle = {Spatial Dynamics of Pushbelt {CVTs}},
	abstract = {Apart from performance, comfort, cost and fun to drive, the reduction of fuel consumption has become a primary driver in the world market of the automotive industry. As continuously variable transmissions based on the pushbelt principle can be operated in an optimal state at any time, they are very suitable to meet the mentioned requirements. However, the power transmission in the system is very complicated. Both detailed measurements and simulations are necessary to understand and to optimize the physical mechanisms, power density and shift characteristics.The current paper presents a spatial simulation model for transient analysis at different levels of detail. An initial model based on non-smooth multi-body theory is outlined. It consists of two rigid pulleys each with one tilting loose sheave. The pushbelt comprises two ring packages based on the co-rotational approach. These guide approximately 400 rigid elements by bilateral friction laws, with possibility for Coulomb and Stribeck curves. Flexible decoupled contact laws with spatial friction between sheaves and elements represent the axial stiffness of the elements. In-between the elements, flexible and frictionless contact laws are chosen. The comparison with local and global measurements validates this approach in realistic load cases.In the main part, improvement possibilities are presented. In particular, the influence of curved strand shapes between the pulleys is discussed. Planar pre-integration strategies are added to reduce the simulation time. The effect of unilateral contact laws between elements and ring packages is examined. Finally, the stiffness of the sheaves is added by coupled quasi-static contact laws.Overall, an efficient framework is shown to investigate the dynamics of individual components, pushbelt misalignment, elastic slip as well as local push and tension forces. This is very important for the economic optimization of the real system without carrying out costly experiments.},

Through more research, the shortages of the bent-generatrix metal V-belt and the method of shifting speed ratio without excursion were pointed out. In order to reduce or eliminate the axial misalignment, an electro-hydraulic control system of metal V-belt type {CVT} has been designed. Being varieties of the working situation of car and the non-linearity of the electro-hydraulic control system, A fuzzy {PID} has been adopted. Then the performance simulation of the electro-hydraulic control system has been conducted. The simulation results showed that the electro-hydraulic control system could eliminate the belt misalignment.},

	abstract = {Allen vorbeschriebenen Umschlingungsgetrieben gemeinsam ist die Erfahrung, daß an einer Reibstelle nur eine geringe Kraft übertragen werden kann. Ein Reibgetriebe, besonders ein Umschlingungsgetriebe, ist also um so leistungsfähiger, je mehr Kraftübertragungsstellen parallel arbeiten. Die Parallelschaltung soll tunlichst so erfolgen, daß an allen Übertragungsstellen die gleiche Geschwindigkeit herrscht, weil sonst zwangsweise ein Relativschlupf auftritt, und das Getriebe mit einem unerwünschten Leistungsverlust belastet wird. Das Problem, alle Übertragungsstellen auf gleiche Geschwindigkeit, also auf gleiche Übersetzung einzustellen und zu halten, ist beim Umschlingungsgetriebe mit keilförmigen Umlaufflächen eigenen Gesetzen unterworfen. Jedes Stück eines Keilriemens oder jedes Glied einer umschlingenden Kette keilt sich zwischen den Doppelkegelscheiben so weit ein, wie es dem dort herrschenden Riemen- oder Kettenzug entspricht, und überträgt eine dieser Einkeilung entsprechende Umfangskraft. Dieses Kraftübertragungssystem ist unabhängig von der Wirkung äußerer Einstellorgane; eine Entwicklung von Verlustleistung zwischen den Kraftübertragungsstellen — etwa derart, daß ein Glied im Umschlingungsbogen voreilt, ein anderes gleichzeitig zurückbleibt —, ist nicht möglich. Um die phy-sikalischen Vorgänge eines solchen Umschlingungsgetriebes zu erkennen, wurden Versuchsergebnisse mit der mathematisch theoretischen Rechnung nach Eytelwein 1 verglichen, was zu beträchtlichen Widersprüchen führte. Als Ursache der Abweichungen wurde von Dittrich 1 der spiralige Umlauf von Zuggliedern auf Kegelscheiben erkannt. Diese charakteristische Eigenschaft keilförmiger Umschlingungsgetriebe wird durch Abb. 189 (zum besseren Verständnis übertrieben dargestellt) erläutert.},

The unilateral constraint contact and the unilateral regularized contact do not take into account the influence of the deformation due to other contacts on a body using rigid body dynamics. In this paper, a third alternative, i.e. the Maxwell-Contact, is derived coupling the deformations of different contacts on one body quasi-statically. An academic example validates the fundamental properties of the contact model and the application in a simulation of a pushbelt {CVT} shows improved results.

The analytical modulation enables to calculate all body forces inside the variator system. The result shows, that the deformation of the transmission parts has no influence on the optimum clamping force. More than that, it can be shown that the body friction has no influence on the transmissions efficiency. It will be possible to calculate maximum reachable efficiency of the variator and the clamping that it will occur at.},

	abstract = {Continuously Variable V-Belt or Chain Transmissions ({CVT}) allow an optimum transforma-
tion of input speed and torque in automotive applications. The operation of a combustion en-
gine at conditions of low specific fuel consumption is therefore possible. One of the sources
of power losses in Continuously Variable Transmissions is the variator itself. Elasticity of the
sheaves, shaft deformations and tilting of the axially moveable disc due to guidance clearance
cause the wedge angle to expand in the contact arc. This can cause radial and tangential slip
between the pins and the pulley, which is known as “spiral path”. This sliding under normal
forces leads to friction losses.
Because the influence of the variator geometry and of the tilting clearance on power losses on
account of sliding friction is not precisely known, several geometry variants with pulleys of
different stiffness and different guidance clearances are tested for energy dissipation and effi-
ciency. These tests are done with rocker pins traction chains and steel push belts. To detect the
deformation of the pulleys and the radial movement of the chain or belt, a measurement sys-
tem is developed and integrated in the test gearbox.
The measurements of radial slip show a significant difference between input and output disc.
The comparison of the investigated geometry variants exhibits an approximately linear rela-
tionship between the maximum change of contact radius and the power losses. In particular,
the influence of the tilting clearance and the free bending-length between the introductory
points of the tilting moments in the shaft can be shown. In the case of very flexible sheaves a
effect of “inversion” occurs. That means that the wedge gap at the point of first contact with
the chain is already expanded, and thus, an increased absolute deformation has no influence
on radial slip.
Secondly, a well known analytic function for the description of the conditions in the contact
arc is extended and applied in a way that allows the analysis of variators with elastic sheaves.
In addition, the function is enhanced by taking small sliding speeds with the possibility for
adhesion into consideration. The {FE} computations of the necessary deformations are accom-
plished by means of a 2D-model employing special harmonic elements.
The convergence of the procedure with arbitrary initial conditions with regard to deformation
and load is demonstrated. For a better handling of this iterative numerical procedure, a compu-
tation environment is developed. The theoretical results and measured values from the ex-
periments are compared, resulting in a good agreement regarding pulley deformation, radial
slip, required clamping force and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Continuously variable transmissions ({CVTs}) are applied in an increasing number of vehicles. Large ratio coverage allows for reduced engine speeds, which adds to both highway driving comfort and reduced fuel consumption. It becomes increasingly important to further improve the performance in terms of efficiency, robustness and torque capacity of the {CVT}. This paper describes the possibilities of improving the {CVT} by minimising variator clamping forces. This is accomplished by using slip control technology. This technique allows for the best possible transmission efficiency, combined with improved robustness for slip damage. This paper first describes the relation between variator slip and functional transmission properties. The conditions for optimum performance regarding efficiency and robustness are identified. This leads to the development of a variator slip controller. The remaining sections describe experimental results on two test rigs and in a production vehicle. The paper concludes with an outlook into further developments.},

	abstract = {With a pushbelt continuously variable transmission the whole drivetrain including the engine of a passenger car can operate in an optimal state at any time. For further improvements with respect to fuel consumption, dynamic simulations of the system were investigated by Bosch and the Institute of Applied Mechanics of the Technische Universität München in the last years.

The underlying mathematical models are characterised by numerous contacts and a large degree of freedom. To avoid high numerical stiffnesses due to springs and to encourage an efficient as well as stable and robust numerical treatment, a nonsmooth contact description is chosen. Time-stepping schemes integrate the resulting measure differential inclusions.

This paper deals with a spatial transient mathematical model of pushbelt continuously variable transmissions to consider also out-of-plane effects, for instance pushbelt misalignment. The equations of motion are derived using methods of multibody theory and nonlinear mechanics. Thereby, the bodies themselves are described using rigid and large deflection elastic mechanical models. In-between the bodies, all possible flexible or rigid contact descriptions namely frictionless unilateral contacts, bilateral contacts with 2D-friction and even unilateral contacts with 3D-friction occur.

In comparison with the planar case the calculation time increases significantly mainly because of the large degree of freedom and the number of contact possibilities. Initial value problems are solved and parallelisation is used to reduce the computational effort.},

	isbn = {9783527618392},
	abstract = {As mechanical systems become more complex so do the mathematical models and simulations used to describe the interactions of their parts. One area of multibody theory that has received a great deal of attention in recent years is the dynamics of multiple contact situations occurring in continuous joints and couplings. Despite the rapid gains in our understanding of what occurs when continuous joints and couplings interact, until now there were no books devoted exclusively to this intriguing phenomenon. Focusing on the concerns of practicing engineers, Multibody Dynamics with Unilateral Contacts presents all theoretical and applied aspects of this subject relevant to a practical understanding of multiple unilateral contact situations in multibody mechanical systems. In Part 1, Professor Pfeiffer and Dr. Glocker provide an exhaustive review of the laws and principles governing the dynamics of unilateral contacts in multibody mechanical and technical systems. Among the topics covered are multibody and contact kinematics, the dynamics of rigid body systems, multiple contact configurations, detachment and stick-slip transitions, frictionless impacts, impacts with friction, and the Corner law of contact dynamics. In Part 2, the authors present numerous applications of the theories presented in Part 1. Each chapter in this part is devoted to a different law, theory, or model, such as discontinuous force laws, classical impact theory, Coulomb's friction law, and mechanical and mathematical models of impacts and friction. In addition, each chapter features several practical examples that allow engineers to observe the concepts described in action. Examples are drawn from a broad array of fields and range from hammering in gears as occurring in a synchronous generator to impacts and friction as observed in a child's woodpecker toy, from a demonstration of classical impact theory using an automobile gear box example, to Coulomb's friction law as applied to a turbine blade damper. Multibody Dynamics with Unilateral Contacts is an indispensable resource for mechanical engineers working on all types of multibody systems and the friction and vibration problems that can occur in them. It is also a valuable reference for researchers studying nonlinear dynamics. The only book devoted entirely to the theory and applications of {onE} of the most crucial aspects of multibody system design. This is the first book to focus exclusively on the theory and applications of multiple contact situations occurring in continuous joints and couplings in multibody systems. As such, it is a valuable resource for engineers working on mechanical systems with interrelated multiple parts. Multibody Dynamics with Unilateral Contacts* Provides a comprehensive examination of the laws and principles governing the dynamics of unilateral contacts in multibody mechanical and technical systems.* Presents the latest mathematical models and simulation techniques for describing the interactions of joints and couplings in multibody systems.* Describes practical applications for all the concepts covered.* Includes numerous examples drawn from a wide range of fascinating and enlightening real-world demonstrations, including everything from an airplane's landing gear to a child's toy.},

Usually nonsmooth dynamical systems are represented as differential inclusions, complementarity systems, evolution variational inequalities, each of these classes being itself split into several subclasses. With detailed examples of multibody systems with contact, impact and friction and electrical circuits with piecewise linear and ideal components, the book is is mainly intended for researchers in Mechanics and Electrical Engineering, but it will be attractive to researchers from other scientific communities like Systems and Control, Robotics, Physics of Granular Media, Civil Engineering, Virtual Reality, Haptic Systems, Computer Graphics, etc.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews the roots, the state-of-the-art and perspectives of multibody system dynamics. Some historical remarks show that multibody system dynamics is based on classical mechanics and its engineering applications ranging from mechanisms, gyroscopes, satellites and robots to biomechanics. The state-of-the-art in rigid multibody systems is presented with reference to textbooks and proceedings. Multibody system dynamics is characterized by algorithms or formalisms, respectively, ready for computer implementation. As a result simulation and animation are most important. The state-of-the-art in flexible multibody systems is considered in a companion review by Shabana. Future research fields in multibody dynamics are identified as standardization of data, coupling with {CAD} systems, parameter identification, real-time animation, contact and impact problems, extension to control and mechatronic systems, optimal system design, strength analysis and interaction with fluids. Further, there is a strong interest on multibody systems in analytical and numerical mathematics resulting in reduction methods for rigorous treatment of simple models and special integration codes for {ODE} and {DAE} representations supporting the numerical efficiency. New software engineering tools with modular approaches promise improved efficiency still required for the more demanding needs in biomechanics, robotics and vehicle dynamics.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a review of past and recent developments in the dynamics of flexible multibody systems is presented. The objective is to review some of the basic approaches used in the computer aided kinematic and dynamic analysis of flexible mechanical systems, and to identify future directions in this research area. Among the formulations reviewed in this paper are the floating frame of reference formulation, the finite element incremental methods, large rotation vector formulations, the finite segment method, and the linear theory of elastodynamics. Linearization of the flexible multibody equations that results from the use of the incremental finite element formulations is discussed. Because of space limitations, it is impossible to list all the contributions made in this important area. The reader, however, can find more references by consulting the list of articles and books cited at the end of the paper. Furthermore, the numerical procedures used for solving the differential and algebraic equations of flexible multibody systems are not discussed in this paper since these procedures are similar to the techniques used in rigid body dynamics. More details about these numerical procedures as well as the roots and perspectives of multibody system dynamics are discussed in a companion review by Schiehlen [79]. Future research areas in flexible multibody dynamics are identified as establishing the relationship between different formulations, contact and impact dynamics, control-structure interaction, use of modal identification and experimental methods in flexible multibody simulations, application of flexible multibody techniques to computer graphics, numerical issues, and large deformation problem. Establishing the relationship between different flexible multibody formulations is an important issue since there is a need to clearly define the assumptions and approximations underlying each formulation. This will allow us to establish guidelines and criteria that define the limitations of each approach used in flexible multibody dynamics. This task can now be accomplished by using the “absolute nodal coordinate formulation” which was recently introduced for the large deformation analysis of flexible multibody systems.},

	url = {http://papers.sae.org/2011-01-1426/},
	abstract = {In designing {CVT} pulleys, the effect of the fit clearance of the movable pulleys and their stiffness on the transmission efficiency and strength of the metal pushing V-belt is not necessarily clear. The research discussed in this paper introduced a pulley model that defined the pulleys as elastic bodies to a previously developed technology for the prediction of the transmission efficiency of the belts. As a result, it was found that when the fit clearance is reduced, the transmission efficiency of the belt is increased, and the amplitude of stress on the innermost rings and the element neck section is reduced. In addition, it was found that if pulley stiffness was reduced transmission efficiency was also reduced, and the amplitude of stress on the element neck section increased.This indicated that the fit clearance and the pulley stiffness changed the degree of deflection of the pulleys in the axial direction. When the pulley deflection changes the winding diameter of the belt, the friction force on the V-surfaces of the elements approaches further in the direction of rotation, and transmission efficiency increases. In addition, the research also discovered that changes in the direct load on the element V-surfaces at the pulley exits affect the level of stress on the element neck sections. Changes in the degree of misalignment of the belt due to pulley deflection were also shown to affect the amplitude of stress on the rings.},

The test method comprises full load testing in several ratios in which durability and functionality related push belt {CVT} items are being examined.

	title = {A Framework for Simulating Deformable Bodies with Complex Geometries in a Multibody System with Sliding Contacts},
	abstract = {In recent years, lightweight, high-speed and precision mechanical systems are becoming
prevalent in industry to save energy as well as material consumption and to achieve higher
productivity and accurate movement. As deformations in these systems significantly
influence dynamics of these multibody systems, the classical rigid body assumption is often
not sufficient. To obtain accurate dynamic analysis of these systems it is necessary to
evolve some components from rigid into flexible body model. This is essential for improving
properties e.g. noise, vibration and harshness ({NVH}) or the controllability of mechanical
systems.
The target of this thesis is to derive a framework to model flexible bodies which undergo
large translational and rotational displacements described in their Floating Frame of
Reference ({FFR}) with additionally small and thus linear deformations for a Multibody-
Simulation-Framework ({MBS}). Additionally a generalized contour description enables
non-smooth sliding contacts between different components in the system.
An interface between commercial {FEM} codes and the {MBS}-Framework is described.
The node mass matrix, mode shape vectors and further geometry information resulting
from {FEM} codes are utilized to obtain time-variant mass matrix, generalized forces and
quadratic velocity vectors of a flexible body of arbitrary shape. This enables an easy
integration of flexible bodies with complex geometries.
Continuous contours are added to these flexible bodies to enable non-smooth sliding
contacts between different components. To preserve general description of the underlying
flexible bodies a contour description using {NURBS}-interpolation is derived, which can
provide a contour with at least C 2 continuity for a sliding contact. The local support
property of {NURBS}-interpolation maybe suits the needs for contact problems.
Model-order-reduction for flexible bodies is done based on nonlinear normal modes of the
deformation. Due to this, the number of nonlinear equations can be significantly reduced
as well as the simulation cost, while the accuracy is guaranteed by comparing it to the full
model.
The theoretical concept is implemented in the multibody simulation framework {MBSim} [1,
25], which is an open source software developed at the Institute of Applied Mechanics of
the Technische Universität München. Benchmarks are performed to test and validate this
framework.},

This paper investigates the belt-related torque loss in a steel V-belt {CVT}. Measurements show that the loss is dependent on the secondary pulley clamping force and on the belt configuration and these results are presented in the paper. A semi-empirical model is proposed to explain the loss. The agreement between the measured results and the values calculated from the model is shown to be good.
It is also shown that when the system is in an overdrive ratio and a high efficiency is particularly important the torque loss is large and the efficiency is severely limited, probably to less than 90 per cent.},

	title = {Nonexpansivity of the Newton’s Cradle Impact Law},
	url = {http://conference.unisalento.it/ocs/public/conferences/1/download/scientific_program/S01.pdf},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present an impact law for Newton’s Cradle with 3 balls which is kinematically and kinetically
consistent and enjoys the maximal monotonicity property. Our aim is to divulge the structure of impact laws
in order to be able to formulate maximal monotone impact laws for rigid multi-body systems that do not have
the problems of existing impact laws such as kinematic, kinetic, and energetic inconsistency [1]. It is interesting
to consider Newton’s Cradle because its phenomena cannot be described by the classical Newton’s or Poisson’s
impact laws.
Kinematic consistency means that the impenetrability of unilateral constraints requires the post-impact
contact velocities γ
+
i
to be non-negative. In view of numerical integration, an impact-law should guarantee that
arbitrary (also kinematically inconsistent) pre-impact contact velocities are mapped to kinematically consistent
post-impact contact velocities.
The interest in the maximal monotonicity property stems from stability analysis and control of mechanical
systems with unilateral constraints [3]. Since the maximal monotonicity property implies dissipativity it seems
to be a physically reasonable property of an impact law.
We consider Newton’s Cradle that consists of three balls of equal mass m that are aligned along the same

allow to reveal further details about the general structure of set-valued impact laws.},

The coefficients of the power loss model are obtained from the experiments. It is found from the simulations and experiments that the steady state belt-pulley loss depends on the line pressure, the input torque, and the rotational speed while the transient loss depends on the rotational speed, the shift speed, and the inertial torque.},

	abstract = {The influence of metal-metal friction characteristics on the efficiency of a continuously variable transmission ({CVT}) of a metal pushing V-belt type was experimentally investigated using a commercial {CVT} unit of a metal belt assembly and pulley design. The experiments for transmission efficiency were carried out, varying the clamping force on the secondary pulley from 10.5 to 34.6 {kN} and the speed ratio from 2.36 (reduction ratio) to 0.44 (overdrive ratio). In order to analyse the metal-metal friction characteristics of each contact pair, a ring-on-disc tribometer was developed. Fluids giving a higher transmittable {CVT} torque capacity of {CVT} were found to have the potential for decreasing the maximum required pulley clamping force, resulting in the reduction of overall power loss in the {CVT} unit. The transmission efficiency of the {CVT} decreased under an overdrive speed ratio and lower load condition. The maximum difference in the efficiency between all the commercial automatic transmission and {CVT} fluids tested at the same pulley clamping force condition reached 3 per cent. This number depends on the friction losses caused by slipping behaviour between the belt segments and pulley, the segments and band, and between the bands. Furthermore, mathematical modelling of the friction loss in the belt was developed. Results calculated by this model were similar to those obtained experimentally.},

	title = {Influence of Different Pulley-Contours on the Kinematics of a Pushbelt Variator},
	url = {http://www.tuhh.de/gacm2013},
	abstract = {In the recent years, a detailed model of a Continuously Pushbelt Variator using spatial dynamics has been
developed at the Institute of Applied Mechanics of the Technische Universität München in
cooperation with Bosch Transmission Technology B.V. The model consists of up to 400 bodies with more
than 5000 interactions combining specialized single- and set-valued force laws resulting in promising results
[1,2]. However due to the complexity of the model, different approaches can be used for both, model
refinement as well as computing time reduction. After an overview of the model, the talk presents a new
kinematical description for the contact between element-flank and pulley-sheave focusing on these two
subjects.
To represent a yawing motion of the elements due to normal forces, the spatial model of [1] uses two circular
arcs (at the front and rear edge) on one element flank that are in contact with flat frustum-shaped pulley-
sheaves together with a decoupled contact law to compute contact forces between element and pulley. A
coupled contact law leads to improved results in local forces as well as e.g. in spiral-running [2]. However
due to the enhanced contact law, a linear complementarity problem ({LCP}) has to be solved for each of the
four pulley-sheaves in every time-step. Using Lemke’s algorithm, the solution-time is growing as a third
order polynomial in the number of contacts.
To study the effects of a convex pulley-sheave compared to a flat description, a new contour-pairing between
element-flank and sheave is introduced. The surface of the sheave is described by a convex polynomial along
the radial direction whereas the element-flank is described by one rectangular flat area. Thus, only one
potential contact point results, leading to a smaller dimension of the {LCP}. The contact point can move along
the element flank and thus a yawing motion of the element is still represented.
A condition for a possible contact point is, that the normal vectors of the contacting contours are in parallel
[3], leading to a one-dimensional non-linear contact point search. However, this is not true if the contact-
point is on the edge of the flank as the normal is not defined uniquely there. Here, two cases have to be
separated: either the contact point is at the corner or the contact point is in the interior of one of the edges. As
the used contact law is not set-valued, a penetration is allowed and thus more than one corner-point might
penetrate the sheave. The contact point is then found by a weighting between all penetrating corner points
leading to a smooth movement of the corner point along the flank.
The new contact-kinematics allows for a detailed investigation on the load movement along the element
flank as well as for an investigation on different sheave-contours and on the effect on the global dynamics.
Although the new contact kinematics is more complex compared to the circle-flat sheave contact, a
computing time reduction is gained in combination with the coupled-contact law as the number of contacts is
reduced.},

	abstract = {A pushbelt continuously variable transmission ({CVT}) consists of about 400 steel elements guided by two loop-
sets and transmitting torque from a primary to a secondary pulley due to ring-tension and element-push forces.
About 1500 degrees of freedom and about 3500 contacts in a spatial model of the system combined with nonlinear
effects and coupled deformations of the single parts lead to a high complexity and not fully understood dynamic
effects.
In the recent years, a joint research project between the Institute of Applied Mechanics of the Technische
Universität München and Bosch Transmission Technology has dealt with the detailed modelling of {CVTs} ([1],
[2] and [3]). The model is implemented in the general framework for nonsmooth multibody systems, {MBSim} [4].
Besides standard elements, i.e. rigid bodies and unilateral spring-dampers, specific elements for the pushbelt
{CVT} have been derived and implemented including e.g. a coupled force law to represent the pulley-sheave
deformation or different nonlinear beam models for the representation of the loop-sets.
This work summarizes the most important findings including a detailed validation of the results comparing
stationary situations in local output curves, e.g. element axial forces, element push forces or spiral running, and
in global output curves, e.g. thrust ratio or transmission torques. Furthermore different modelling techniques
are compared concerning physical influence (i.e. forces and kinematics), but also numerical output (e.g. smooth
vs. nonsmooth dynamics).},
