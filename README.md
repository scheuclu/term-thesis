   This thesis deals with adaptive precondtitioned FETI methods.
   <br/>
   The objective was to to analyze the properties of so-called adaptive multi-preconditioned conjugate gradient methods in the FETI context, as well as the derivation of appropriate adaption criteria.
   <br/>
   Special focus was put on the properties of the algorithms for numerically challenging problems such as heterogeneities or near-incompressibility.
